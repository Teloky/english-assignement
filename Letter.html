            My name is Jose Moctezuma
        </h1>
        <p>
              my summer went pretty well I would say. I did summer homework mostly for AP chemistry And
              <a href="https://github.com/Teloky" target="_blank" class="Letter"> I was learning how to code. I learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, learning the basics with Python, </a>
              <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeYWbF6EjFQ' target="_blank" class="Letter">I played a lot of osu mania</a>
               and work. I like playing tboi and learning about languages. I donâ€™t like disrespectful people, especially people who don't say 'excuse me 'after burping. My dream is to be a marine biologist, especially a mammalogy marine biologist when I get much older and try to get an internship at the shedd aquarium or work there.
               In english I really like when we have to present something or discuss something in a whole class that I know about like the frankenstein question of should Victor make a partner or a friend.(He should have made a partner). But I was much more scared to present but then I realized that people will always say things to you no 
               matter if them are saying in front of you or behind you and no matter if you are right or wrong someone will always disagree with you. So I decide that I don't care how people think about me and my interest and thought about me as a human being. So I would do the presentation normally and like to talk about the topics for a while. 
               I most likely need some help with grammar that has been my weak point for the longest I have been knowing. And that is me as a person/human being.
